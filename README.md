# Goodwill Protocol & Resource Allocation Protocol Smart Contracts
Goodwill Economy are driven by Goodwill Coins Smart Contracts that work together to push forward and realize a cause, idea or vision. While most activities are available via BEGINNING’s user friendly site, https://beginning.world, for users familiar with Ethereum Smart Contracts, direct interaction with Goodwill Coins Smart Contract API is also possible.
